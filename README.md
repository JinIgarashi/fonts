`Proxima` font files (.otf) are from [UNDP Design System GitHub repo](https://github.com/undp/design-system/tree/master/docs/fonts).

`.otf` files were converted by [font-maker](https://maplibre.org/font-maker/) provided by maplibre.org

Other prepared fonts of Noto Sans, Open Sans and Roboto were added from [watergis/font-glyphs](https://github.com/watergis/font-glyphs) repo.
